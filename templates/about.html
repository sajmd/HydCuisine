            <h3>Qubani ka Meetha</h3>
            <p>
                Soak the apricots in enough water (just to cover the apricots) overnight. They will become rehydrated and plumpy.
                If the apricots are not pitted then remove the seeds. My apricots are already pitted so I skip this step.
                Heat the apricots and water together, add a stick of cinnamon or few pods of cardamom or even a star anise if you
                wish to. This is just to infuse the flavour in the dessert.
                Few drops of lemon or orange extract, if you have. I added few drops of orange extract and it heightened the flavor
                to another extent.
                Now add the sugar and keep stirring.
                I love the way how sugar slowly caramelises.
                Keep stirring and cook on low heat till it reaches a mushy consistency.
                At this stage you can puree it for a smooth texture and this is more traditional way of doing it or you can leave it
                half crushed.
                Qubani ka meetha is ready and you can serve it warm or cold with saffron cream, garnished with slivered almonds or
                apricot kernels.
                Give some wings to your imagination and present it in a different style like this - apricot pudding trifle.
                For this take a dessert glass and put the base layer of finely chopped almonds, pistachios, walnuts etc.
                Pour the apricot pudding over it. Top it with saffron cream. If requires repeat the steps and serve chilled!!
